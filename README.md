This project focuses on predicting whether an employee earns more than $50K per year using machine learning techniques.

We used the 'adult' Dataset (renamed as employee.csv) to build a classification model. The dataset includes various demographic and employment-related features such as age, education, occupation, hours-per-week, and more.

The project includes the following steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature encoding and scaling
Model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Cross-validation and feature importance analysis

Goal: To create a data-driven model that can assist organizations in understanding salary patterns and predicting employee income categories effectively.
